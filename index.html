          <p class="hp">
            The history of the Thingyan water festival in Myanmar dating back from a very long time ago originated from the Buddhist version of a Hindu myth.
            Thingyan, in Sanskrit language (the language of ancient India), means “transit of the Sun from Pisces to Aries.
            The legend said that the Thingyan festival is an event to henceforth to signify the changing hands of the Brahma’s head – a powerful deity that lost his head in a gamble with Devas.
            Nowadays, the Thingyan water festival in Myanmar is renowned as the most cherished event for people to wish for good health and luck to all people who attend.

          <p class="hp">
            There were several versions of how Burmese people celebrate the Thingyan festival.
            In the past, the water festival in Myanmar is varied from region to region.
            If in Mon State, people often prepare a special dish from dried snakehead fish, onion, green mangoes, and beeswax, in Shan State, people observe three other traditional celebrations in
            the water festival.
            Notwithstanding these differences,
            on the first day of the Thingyan Water Festival is an occasion to take place in many religious activities.
            Yangon and Nay Pyi Taw are two destinations witness the biggest celebration of the Thingyan festival. During the festival time, there will be many trucks run around the street to pick up people. Burmese people are friendly and hospitable. Therefore, if you expect to be picked and roll out with them to experience the madness of the festival, they are always welcome you with an open arm. The third and fourth days are two following days of the water fighting. Attending the festival, tourists are able to enjoy another highlight of the Thingyan festival: the free food distribution on the street including some hot coffee, fried noodles, and traditional Thingyan snacks. Don’t be surprised that you will not have to spend any money to enjoy it! Burmese people are happy to give it to everyone! Together with the lively water fighting, traveling to the Golden Rock in Kyaikhtiyo Pagoda is also a favorite activity for prayers and worshipers. However, you should remember that traveling out of Yangon during the festival can be pricey cause transportation is limited during 5 days of the festival.
